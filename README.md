I'm a Learning and Language technologist from Barcelona, Spain.

I am the Head of [Educational Technology](https://github.com/funiber-edtech) and [Translation](https://github.com/funiber-trad) at Fundaci√≥n Universitaria Iberoamericana (FUNIBER).

I have a bachelor's degree in Translation and Interpreting from [Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)](https://www.upf.edu/). I'm pursuing a master's degree in Game Design and Programming at [Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC)](https://www.uoc.edu/).

Even if it's a bit empty at the moment, you can check out my [gamedev portfolio](https://ragart.itch.io/), where I upload the games I make for my master's degree. I also have a [blog](https://sbanderas.folio.uoc.edu/) (in Spanish) where I write about their development.

If you like what I do want to support me, you can [buy me a üå∂Ô∏è chili](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ragart) or [donate to my Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/ragart). Thank you in advance!
