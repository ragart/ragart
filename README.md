I'm a learning and language technologist from Barcelona, Spain.

I'm currently working as the Head of Educational Technology and Translation at [Fundaci√≥n Universitaria Iberoamericana (FUNIBER)](https://github.com/funiber-edtech).

I have a Bachelor's degree in Translation and Interpreting from [Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)](https://www.upf.edu/) and I'm studying a Master's degree in Game Design and Programming at [Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC)](https://www.uoc.edu/).

If you like what I do and you'd like to support me, you can do so by [buying me a üå∂Ô∏è chili](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ragart). Thank you in advance!
